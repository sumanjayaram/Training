What is the Saga pattern?
a) A design pattern for managing long-running transactions
b) A pattern for implementing microservices architectures
c) A pattern for handling data consistency in distributed systems - Correct
d) A pattern for handling failures and retries in messaging systems

Which statement best describes the Saga pattern?
a) It uses a centralized coordinator to manage the execution of distributed transactions
b) It relies on a decentralized approach where each service manages its own transactions
c) It guarantees strong consistency across distributed systems
d) It is primarily used for handling communication failures between microservices - Correct

In the Saga pattern, what is a compensating transaction?
a) A transaction that compensates for a failed transaction and undoes its effects - Correct
b) A transaction that compensates for a successful transaction and reverts its effects
c) A transaction that handles communication failures between microservices
d) A transaction that ensures data consistency across distributed systems

Which of the following is a characteristic of the Saga pattern?
a) It guarantees ACID properties for distributed transactions
b) It provides a simple and lightweight solution for managing long-running transactions
c) It eliminates the need for distributed transactions altogether - Correct
d) It can only be implemented using a synchronous communication model

What is the main advantage of using the Saga pattern?
a) It provides strong consistency across distributed systems - Correct
b) It simplifies the management of long-running transactions
c) It reduces the need for compensating transactions
d) It eliminates the possibility of data inconsistency in distributed systems

What does CQRS stand for?
a) Command Query Responsibility Segregation - Correct
b) Centralized Query Response System
c) Concurrent Query Response Strategy
d) Continuous Query Result Segmentation

What is the main idea behind CQRS?
a) Separating the responsibility of handling commands from the responsibility of handling queries - Correct
b) Combining commands and queries into a single interface for simplicity
c) Eliminating the need for a database in an application architecture
d) Enabling distributed transactions across multiple microservices

Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between commands and queries in CQRS?
a) Commands modify the state of the system, while queries retrieve data from the system.
b) Commands and queries perform the same actions but with different naming conventions.
c) Commands and queries are interchangeable and can be used interchangeably in the system.
d) Commands and queries are completely unrelated in the CQRS pattern. - Correct

What is an advantage of using CQRS in an application architecture?
a) It simplifies the implementation of complex business logic. - Correct
b) It improves the performance of read operations by optimizing the data model.
c) It eliminates the need for security measures in the application.
d) It allows for real-time data synchronization across multiple databases.

Which of the following is a typical component in a CQRS-based system?
a) Command Bus
b) Query Bus
c) Event Store
d) All of the above- Correct
What is the primary purpose of transaction management in Spring?
